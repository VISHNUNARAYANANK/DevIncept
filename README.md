* ## Steps to bulild File Manager in Python
Our goal in this project is to come with our file manager.
## Step 1: Importing all required modules
* We will import the following modules:
* **Tkinter:** It provides wide API for GUI functionlities.
* **Shutil:** This module offers a number of high-level operations on files and collection of files.
* **Os:** utility module for OS interaction in programs.
* **easygui:** It allows us to select any file from the system.
* **Filedialog:** This libraay is used for folder selection.
* **Imageio:** This is used to read the chosen file.
## Step 2: Defining functionalities
In this step, we will define all the functions which will be linked afterward to different buttons
* **Opening a file box:** It opens the file box,i.e the pop-up box to choose the file from the device, which opens every time we run the code. 
fileopenbox() is the method in easyGUI module which returns the path of the chosen file as a string.
